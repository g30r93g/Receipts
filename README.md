# Receipts

## Backstory

I was waiting at McDonalds for my order and looked at how long the receipt was and thought,
"Was all that ink and paper really necessary to tell me that my order number is 27 and that I ordered a Fanta?"
Then my friend told me that receipts aren't recyclable due to the paper having plastic in it.
And here I am, doing my bit for the planet :)

## How it works

 1. User signs up for account
 2. A unique QR code is generated
 3. When at a supported shop, the user scans their QR code
 4. After the transaction is successful, the receipt contents and payment information are sent to the user's app to be viewed
